# Quick Start Guide for Teammates

## For First Time Setup (New Users)

If this is your first time running the application:

### Option 1: One Command Setup & Run (Recommended)

```bash
bash start.sh
```

This will:

- Check Python installation
- Create virtual environment
- Install all dependencies
- Create config.ini
- Run migrations
- Start the application

### Option 2: Step by Step

```bash
# 1. Run setup
bash setup.sh

# 2. Edit config.ini with your database credentials
nano config.ini

# 3. Run the application
bash run.sh
```

---

## For Regular Use (After Initial Setup)

Once setup is complete, just run:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

or simply:

```bash
./run.sh
```

---

## Available Scripts

### `setup.sh` - First Time Setup

Complete setup including virtual environment, dependencies, and configuration.

```bash
bash setup.sh
```

### `run.sh` - Run Application

Start the application (after setup).

```bash
bash run.sh              # Start app
bash run.sh --migrate    # Run database migrations
bash run.sh --test       # Run test suite
bash run.sh --help       # Show help
```

### `start.sh` - Quick Start

Setup + Run in one command.

```bash
bash start.sh
```

## Default Login Credentials

```
Username: admin
Password: admin123
```

**IMPORTANT:** Change the admin password after first login!

---

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, make sure you have:

1. **Python 3.7+** installed

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```

2. **pip3** installed

   ```bash
   pip3 --version
   ```

3. **MySQL database** accessible (or Aiven MySQL)
   - Database name: `market_price_tracker`
   - User with proper permissions

---

## Database Configuration

The setup script will create `config.ini` from the template. Edit it with your database credentials:

```ini
[database]
host = your_database_host
port = 3306
user = your_database_user
password = your_database_password
database = market_price_tracker
```

For Aiven MySQL, it looks like:

```ini
[database]
host = mysql-xxxxx.aivencloud.com
port = 14702
user = avnadmin
password = your_aiven_password
database = market_price_tracker
```

**IMPORTANT: About Database Migrations**

Since you're using **Aiven** (cloud-hosted shared database):

- **Migrations only need to run ONCE** - by the first person setting up
- If a teammate already ran migrations, **skip it** when `setup.sh` asks
- The database is shared among all team members
- You'll see "table already exists" errors if trying to migrate an already-set-up database (this is normal and OK!)

**When to run migrations:**

- First person setting up the project
- After pulling new database schema changes from git
- Every time you start the app (not needed!)
- When a teammate already set up the database

---

## Troubleshooting

### Script Permission Denied

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh run.sh start.sh
```

### Python Not Found

Install Python 3.7+:

- **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip`
- **macOS:** `brew install python3`
- **Windows:** Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/

### Virtual Environment Issues

Remove and recreate:

```bash
rm -rf .venv
bash setup.sh
```

### Database Connection Failed

1. Check `config.ini` credentials
2. Verify database exists
3. Test connection:
   ```bash
   mysql -h hostname -u username -p database_name
   ```

### Dependencies Installation Failed

Try manual installation:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## What Each Script Does

### setup.sh

1.  Checks Python & pip installation
2.  Creates virtual environment (.venv)
3.  Activates virtual environment
4.  Upgrades pip
5.  Installs all dependencies from requirements.txt
6.  Creates config.ini from template
7.  Prompts to edit database credentials
8.  Offers to run database migrations
9.  Creates run.sh script

### run.sh

1.  Checks virtual environment exists
2.  Activates virtual environment
3.  Checks config.ini exists
4.  Runs migrations (if --migrate flag)
5.  Runs tests (if --test flag)
6.  Starts main application
7.  Deactivates virtual environment on exit

### start.sh

1.  Makes scripts executable
2.  Runs setup.sh
3.  Runs application automatically

---

## For Windows Users

If you're on Windows, use:

```bash
# Git Bash (recommended)
bash setup.sh
bash run.sh

# Or PowerShell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main_enhanced.py
```

---

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
bash run.sh --test
```

Or manually:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
python tests/test_features.py
```

---

## Common Workflows

### First Day Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mgpacifique/market_price_tracker.git
cd market_price_tracker
bash start.sh
```

### Daily Use

```bash
cd market_price_tracker
bash run.sh
```

### After Database Changes

```bash
bash run.sh --migrate
```

### Before Committing Code

```bash
bash run.sh --test
```

## Need Help?

1. Check [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed usage
2. Read [docs/INSTALLATION.md](docs/INSTALLATION.md) for manual setup
3. See [docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md) for development
4. Contact team lead or check project issues

---

## Summary

**Absolute Beginner?** → Use `bash start.sh`  
**Already Setup?** → Use `bash run.sh`  
**Need Migrations?** → Use `bash run.sh --migrate`  
**Want to Test?** → Use `bash run.sh --test`

That's it!
